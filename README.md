# Life Simulation Game

## Project Status: In Active Development

This project is an AI-driven life simulation game that aims to provide a rich, open-ended experience where players can live out a virtual life through natural language inputs.

**Note:** This project is still under active development. While you can experiment with basic functionality, many features are not yet fully implemented or may change significantly in future updates.

## Current Features

- Basic life simulation with attributes like location, age, job, money, health, happiness, education, relationships, and skills
- Natural language processing for interpreting player inputs
- Random location generation with associated descriptions and available jobs
- Simple job application and work system
- Basic skill learning and relationship building
- Status checking to view current life statistics

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/connosuer/trekk.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd trekk
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

After starting the game, you'll find yourself in a random location. You can interact with the game world using natural language commands. For example:

- "get a job as a teacher"
- "move to Tokyo"
- "learn programming"
- "talk to Sarah"

Type "help" at any time to see a list of available commands.
